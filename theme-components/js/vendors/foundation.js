/*

	To use the above components, add the codekit line to the global scripts file.
	Then added the following commented out line after the foundation scripts.

	$(document).foundation();
	

	It is important that you always include the first foundation.js with the other components,
	if you want to use foundations javascript components.

	This is an effort to minimize the number of scripts we use on a site.

	If you want to use all of foundation then you can use require by adding foundations fully minimized scripts
	into the .master file.
